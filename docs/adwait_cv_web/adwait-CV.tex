\subsection*{PUBLICATIONS}
\hrule
\vspace{0.2cm}
{\bf Note:} In my sub-discipline (computer hardware architecture) of computer science, conference publication 
is preferred to journal publication, and the premier conferences are generally more selective than the premier journals. 
The premier conferences in computer hardware architecture and related areas (not in any particular order)
are: MICRO, ISCA, HPCA, ASPLOS, PACT, SIGMETRICS, DAC, DATE. The
acceptance rate of all these premier conferences is around 20\%. 
See \url{https://www.cs.ucsd.edu/sites/cse/files/cse/assets/docs/arch.pdf} for more details.  \\
