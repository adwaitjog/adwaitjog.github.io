<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>Students are expected to have a good understanding of the basic
computer organization and design. Please talk to the instructor if you do not
satisfy this requirement. </p>
<h2>Course Description</h2>
<p>This is a seminar-type graduate course, where
we will discuss research papers on many
different topics (e.g., cache or memory systems, scheduling, resource
management, micro-architecture, emerging technologies/architectures)
in the broad areas of computer architecture and systems.
Students are expected to read a variety of
papers, critique them, and present them in the front of the class. In
addition, students are expected to complete a semester-long project.</p>
<h2>Grade Distribution</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>In-Class Presentations: 30%</p>
</li>
<li><p>Paper critiques and homeworks: 20%</p>
</li>
<li><p>Semester Long Project: 50%</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Submissions</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Critique and Homework Submissions via Blackboard or Email (To be decided later).</p>
</li>
<li><p>In-Class Presentations will be uploaded on Blackboard.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Semester Long Project Report Submissions need to be emailed to the instructor. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Grade submission via Blackboard/Banner.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>In-Class Presentations, Paper Critiques, and Homeworks</h2>
<p>Each student will present three to four papers throughout the semester. When you 
present a paper, be prepared to answer a variety of questions asked by the instructor 
or other fellow students. The goal is to make class lively. If you plan to audit the 
course, you are required to present at least two papers. A list of papers will be provided
to students. They can choose from that list or come up with their own suggestions. Suggestions
would need approval from the instructor. </p>
<p>All students are required to submit a detailed critique for each paper we discuss 
in the class. To learn the material, some homeworks will also be given. 
<i>No collaboration is allowed on critiques and homeworks.</i></p>
<h2>Semester Long Project</h2>
<p>Students are expected to perform a semester-long research
project. All projects need to be approved by the instructor. Students can 
work in groups if they wish, but not more than <b>2</b> students are allowed to be 
in a single group. Please contact the instructor early to brainstrom 
potential project topics. <br />
<b>Project Timeline (exact dates will be announced later)</b> <br />
