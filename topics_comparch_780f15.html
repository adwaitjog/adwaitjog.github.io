</ul>
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>Students are expected to have a good understanding of the basic
computer organization and design. Please talk to the instructor if 
you do not satisfy this requirement. </p>
<h2>Course Description</h2>
<p>This is a seminar-type graduate course, where
we will discuss research papers on many
different topics (e.g., cache or memory systems, scheduling, resource
management, micro-architecture, emerging technologies/architectures)
in the broad areas of computer architecture and systems.
Students are expected to read a variety of
papers, critique them, and present them in the front of the class. In
addition, students are expected to complete a semester-long research project.</p>
<h2>Grade Distribution</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>In-Class Presentations: 30%</p>
</li>
<li><p>Paper critiques and homeworks: 20%</p>
</li>
<li><p>Semester-long Research Project: 50%</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Submissions</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Critique and Homework Submissions via Blackboard or Email (To be decided later).</p>
</li>
<li><p>In-Class Presentations will be uploaded on Blackboard.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Semester-long Research Project Report Submissions need to be emailed to the instructor. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Final Grade submission via Banner.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>In-Class Presentations </h2>
<p>Each student will present a maximum of three papers throughout the semester. 
If you plan to audit the course, you are required to present at least two papers.
When you 
present a paper, be prepared to answer a variety of questions asked by the instructor 
or other fellow students. The goal is to make class lively. A list of papers will be provided
to students. They can choose from that list or come up with their own suggestions. Suggestions
would need approval from the instructor. </p>
<p>Duration of each class is 80 min. I expect students to first present necessary background (~15 min)
and then paper details (~25 min). The remaining (~40 min) will be reserved for discussions driven 
by the fellow students and the instructor. In short, we brainstorm one paper (including associated issues) 
per class.</p>
<h2>Paper Critiques and Homeworks</h2>
<p>All students are required to submit a detailed critique for each paper we discuss 
in the class. However, the student who presents the paper in-class is not required
to submit the critque for that particular paper. Deadline for critique submission
is one week from when the paper is discussed in-class. </p>
<p>Each critique should not exceed one-page and must consists of four 
sections: 1) paper summary, 2) strengths, 3) weaknesses, 4) detailed
comments. More details are already discussed in class and associated
slides are posted on black-board.</p>
<p>To learn the background material related to each new topic, 
some homeworks will also be given. </p>
<p><i>No collaboration is allowed on critiques and homeworks.</i></p>
<h2>Semester-Long Research Project</h2>
<p>Students are expected to perform a semester-long research
project. All projects need to be approved by the instructor. Students can 
work in groups if they wish, but not more than <b>2</b> students are allowed to be 
in a single group. Please contact the instructor early to brainstrom 
potential project topics. <br />
