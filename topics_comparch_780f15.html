</ul>
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>Students are expected to have a good understanding of the basic
computer organization and design. Please talk to the instructor if 
you do not satisfy this requirement. </p>
<h2>Course Description</h2>
<p>This is a seminar-type graduate course, where
we will discuss research papers on many
different topics (e.g., cache or memory systems, scheduling, resource
management, micro-architecture, emerging technologies/architectures)
in the broad areas of computer architecture and systems.
Students are expected to read a variety of
papers, critique them, and present them in the front of the class. In
addition, students are expected to complete a semester-long research project.</p>
<h2>Grade Distribution</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>In-Class Presentations: 30%</p>
</li>
<li><p>Paper critiques and homeworks: 20%</p>
</li>
<li><p>Semester-long Research Project: 50%</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Submissions</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Critique and Homework Submissions via Blackboard or Email (To be decided later).</p>
</li>
<li><p>In-Class Presentations will be uploaded on Blackboard.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Semester-long Research Project Report Submissions need to be emailed to the instructor. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Final Grade submission via Banner.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>In-Class Presentations </h2>
<p>Each student will present maximum three papers throughout the semester. When you 
present a paper, be prepared to answer a variety of questions asked by the instructor 
or other fellow students. The goal is to make class lively. If you plan to audit the 
course, you are required to present at least two papers. A list of papers will be provided
to students. They can choose from that list or come up with their own suggestions. Suggestions
would need approval from the instructor. </p>
<p>Duration of each class is 80 min. I expect students to first present necessary background (~15 min)
and then paper details (~25 min). The remaining (~40 min) will be reserved for discussions driven 
by the fellow students and the instructor. In short, we brainstorm one paper (including associated issues) 
per class.</p>
<h2>Paper Critiques and Homeworks</h2>
<p>All students are required to submit a detailed critique for each paper we discuss 
in the class. However, the student who presents the paper in-class is not required
to submit the critque for that particular paper. Deadline for critique submission
is one week from when the paper is discussed in-class. </p>
<p>Each critique should not exceed one-page and must consists of four 
sections: 1) paper summary, 2) strengths, 3) weaknesses, 4) detailed
comments. More details are already discussed in class and associated
slides are posted on black-board.</p>
<p>To learn the background material related to each new topic, 
some homeworks will also be given. </p>
<p><i>No collaboration is allowed on critiques and homeworks.</i></p>
<h2>Semester-Long Research Project</h2>
<p>Students are expected to perform a semester-long research
project. All projects need to be approved by the instructor. Students can 
work in groups if they wish, but not more than <b>2</b> students are allowed to be 
in a single group. Please contact the instructor early to brainstrom 
potential project topics. <br />
