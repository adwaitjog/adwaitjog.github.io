== About
I am an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science
at [http://goo.gl/JP9omL William & Mary] in Virginia, USA. At William & Mary, 
I am leading the [http://insight-archlab.github.io /Insight Computer Architecture Lab/]. 
Our goal is to generate insights necessary in order to architect future computers that 
are more energy-efficient, capable, reliable, and secure. \n

As per [http://csrankings.org/ CS Rankings], William & Mary ranks among top 30 
US universities in the area of computer architecture. This ranking is based on 
publications at top venues (HPCA, MICRO, ASPLOS, ISCA) in the area of computer 
architecture. \n

*\<span style=\"color: red\"\> I am always looking for self-motivated 
students to join my lab. \<\/span\>* Interested students can email me
to begin the conversation. If you are interested in graduate studies, please 
formally apply to the [https://www.wm.edu/as/computerscience/graduate/admission/index.php 
Ph.D. program at CS department].
