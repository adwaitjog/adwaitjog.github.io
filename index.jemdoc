== About
I am an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science
at [http://goo.gl/JP9omL William & Mary] in Virginia, USA. At William & Mary, 
I am leading the [http://insight-archlab.github.io /Insight Computer Architecture Lab/]. 
Our goal is to generate insights necessary in order to architect future computers that 
are more energy-efficient, capable, reliable, and secure. \n

As per [http://csrankings.org/ CS Rankings], William & Mary ranks among top 30 
US universities in the area of computer architecture. This ranking is based on 
publications at top venues (HPCA, MICRO, ASPLOS, ISCA) in the area of computer 
architecture. \n

*\<span style=\"color: red\"\> I am always looking for self-motivated 
students to join my lab. We have several funded RA positions. \<\/span\>* 
Send me a /brief/ email with your CV (with GRE/TOEFL scores) to start the 
conversation. All graduate admissions are formally managed by 
the [http://www.wm.edu/as/computerscience/graduate/ Department of Computer Science].
