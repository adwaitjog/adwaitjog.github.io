I am a member of [http://www.cse.psu.edu/hpcl High Performance Computing Lab] at Penn State, where I 
work with my advisors [http://www.cse.psu.edu/people/das Chita Das] and [http://www.cse.psu.edu/~kandemir Mahmut Kandemir]. My research interests lie in the broad areas of computer architecture and systems. Primarily, I am interested
in designing performance and energy-efficient GPU-based platforms that are making headway in almost every kind 
of computing system ranging from warehouse-scale to wearable computers. I am also interested in rethinking the 
hardware/software interface for GPU-based heterogeneous computing systems and leveraging emerging memory technologies to design memory and storage systems for them. In recognition of my work, I have received the Best Graduate Research Assistant award in 2013 at Penn State ([https://www.cse.psu.edu/news/2014/20140422-1 CSE Department News]) and was selected as one of 25 finalists for an NVIDIA Ph.D. Fellowship in 2013 ([http://www.cse.psu.edu/news/2013/20130509-1 CSE Department News]). In the past, I worked as an intern with NVIDIA Research in the summer of 2013, Intel Labs in the summer of 2012, and Intel Corp. in the 
summer of 2011. Before joining Penn State in Fall 2009 with College of Engineering Fellowship, I completed my undergraduate studies at [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_of_Technology,_Rourkela NIT Rourkela, India]. \n
