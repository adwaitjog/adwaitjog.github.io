== About
I am an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science
at [http://goo.gl/JP9omL College of William & Mary (W&M)] in Virginia, USA. At W&M, I 
am leading the [http://insight-archlab.github.io /Insight Computer Architecture Lab/] with 
the goal to generate insights, which would help in architecting future computers that are 
more energy-efficient, capable, reliable, and secure. \n

*\<span style=\"color: red\"\> I am always looking for self-motivated and 
talented students to join my lab. We have several funded RA positions. \<\/span\>* 
Send me a /brief email/ to start the conversation. All graduate admissions are formally managed 
by [http://www.wm.edu/as/computerscience/graduate/ W&M CS department].

== Recent News
- W&M published a featured [https://www.wm.edu/as/computerscience/news/using_career_award_jog.php news item] on my group's work and recently granted [https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1750667 NSF CAREER Award].
- I will be teaching a [http://acaces.hipeac.net/2018/index.php?page=courseinfo&lecturer=jog short GPU course] 
at the computer architecture summer school organized annually by HiPEAC. See more 
details [http://acaces.hipeac.net/2018/index.php?page=courseinfo&lecturer=jog here]. 
Registration details can be found [http://acaces.hipeac.net/2018/index.php?page=form here]. Stay tuned for course materials.
- I am grateful and honored to receive [https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1750667 NSF CAREER Award 2018]. 
Over the next five years, this 
award will support my group to research on large-scale GPU-based systems and to pursue my teaching/outreach goals. Thanks NSF!
- Co-organizing second version of the workshop on minimizing data movement ([http://insight-archlab.github.io/minmove.html Min-Move]). It will be co-located with [https://www.asplos2018.org/ ASPLOS 2018].
- As a part of outreach, I gave a talk titled /Computer Science: Myths,  Challenges, and Opportunties/ to high school students attending Focusing on the Future (FOF) conference organized by School of Education, W&M. 
- Paper accepted in [https://www.asplos2018.org/ ASPLOS 2018].
- Our newly formed [http://insight-archlab.github.io/ Insight Computer Architecture Lab] will showcase 
two accepted papers at [https://hpca2018.ece.ucsb.edu/ HPCA 2018]. 
-- We have developed new memory bandwidth management techniques for efficient and fair multi-application execution in GPUs.
-- We have developed new randomized coalescing mechanisms for efficiently balancing performance and security in GPUs.
- Invited to be on the Program Committees of [http://www.ispass.org/ispass2018/ ISPASS 2018] and [https://gpgpu11.000webhostapp.com/ GPGPU-11 2018]. Submit your best work!
- Co-organized a workshop on minimizing data movement ([http://insight-archlab.github.io/minmove.html Min-Move 2017]) co-located with PACT 2017. The workshop was a great success.
- As a part of outreach, I gave a talk on /Career Opportunities in CS/ to middle school students attending Focusing on the Future (FOF) conference organized by School of Education, W&M.
- Received [https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1717532 NSF SHF Award 2017], PI. Thanks NSF!
