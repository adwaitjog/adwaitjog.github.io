== About

I am an Associate Professor (with Tenure) and Anita Jones Faculty Fellow in the Department of Computer Science at the [https://engineering.virginia.edu/faculty/adwait-jog University of Virginia]. I am also 
an associate editor of IEEE Micro and IEEE Transactions on Cloud Computing (TCC). My research interests lie in the broad area of computer architecture/systems with a special focus on GPUs and memory systems. A high-level summary of my group's prior work can be found [https://www.wm.edu/news/stories/2020/computer-science-as-moores-law-slows-down,-the-insight-architecture-lab-accelerates.php here] and [https://www.wm.edu/news/stories/2018/using-a-career-award-to-advance-the-insight-computer-architecture-lab.php here].
