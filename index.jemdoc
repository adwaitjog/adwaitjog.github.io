== About
I am an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science
at [http://goo.gl/JP9omL College of William & Mary (W&M)] in Virginia, USA. At W&M, I 
am leading the [http://insight-archlab.github.io /Insight Computer Architecture Lab/] with 
the goal to generate insights, which would help in architecting future computers that are 
more energy-efficient, capable, reliable, and secure. \n

*\<span style=\"color: red\"\> I am always looking for self-motivated and 
talented students to join my lab. We have several funded RA positions. \<\/span\>* 
Send me a /brief email/ to start the conversation. All graduate admissions are formally managed 
by [http://www.wm.edu/as/computerscience/graduate/ W&M CS department].

== Recent News
- I will be teaching a [http://acaces.hipeac.net/2018/index.php?page=courseinfo&lecturer=jog short GPU course] at the computer architecture summer school organized annually by HiPEAC. See more 
details [http://acaces.hipeac.net/2018/index.php?page=courseinfo&lecturer=jog here]. 
- I delivered talks at the ECE departments of [https://www.ece.ncsu.edu/seminar/memory-bandwidth-management-for-enhanced-throughput-and-security-in-gpus/ NCSU] and 
[https://www.ece.seas.gwu.edu/ece-seminar-%E2%80%9Cmemory-bandwidth-management-enhanced-throughput-and-security-gpus%E2%80%9D GWU] on memory bandwidth management techniques for performance and security. Talk slides are

- W&M published a featured [https://www.wm.edu/as/computerscience/news/using_career_award_jog.php news item] on my group's work and recently granted [https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1750667 NSF CAREER Award].
- Paper accepted in [https://www.asplos2018.org/ ASPLOS 2018].
- Our newly formed [http://insight-archlab.github.io/ Insight Computer Architecture Lab] will showcase two accepted papers at [https://hpca2018.ece.ucsb.edu/ HPCA 2018]. 
-- We have developed new memory bandwidth management techniques for efficient and fair multi-application execution in GPUs.
-- We have developed new randomized coalescing mechanisms for efficiently balancing performance and security in GPUs.
