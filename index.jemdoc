== About
I am an assistant professor of computer science 
at [http://goo.gl/JP9omL The College of William and Mary (W&M)] [http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/college-of-william-and-mary-231624/overall-rankings (US News Rankings)] in Virginia, USA. At W&M, I have started a new 
research group with the goal of designing future computing systems more energy-efficient, reliable, secure, capable, and useful. \n

/I am currently teaching an undergraduate course: [http://adwaitjog.github.io/teach/comp_arch_cs424_f16.html CS 424-524, Computer Architecture]/

== Recent News
- Papers accepted in HPCA 2017 and VLSID 2017
- Papers accepted in IISWC, PACT (2), MICRO, and SIGMETRICS 2016.  
- Invited to serve on the Program Committees of [http://dsn2017.github.io/ DSN 2017], [http://www.hpdc.org/2017/ HPDC 2017], and [http://gpgpu10.athoura.com/ GPGPU 2017]. 
Submit your best work.
- *\<span style=\"color: red\"\>Looking for self-motivated students to join my research group. If you 
are interested in doing research related to any aspects of computer architecture, please send me your CV.
I am especially interested in the areas related to GPU computing, memory systems, and emerging/non-traditional 
computing architectures. Students interested in other disciplines such as (but not limited to) biology, economics, 
machine learning, security, and quantum physics, are also welcome to initiate a discussion with me to explore 
cross-disciplinary research opportunities.
