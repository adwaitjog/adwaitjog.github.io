== About
I am an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science
at [http://goo.gl/JP9omL College of William & Mary (W&M)] in Virginia, USA. At W&M, I 
am leading the [http://insight-archlab.github.io /Insight Computer Architecture Lab/]. Our
goal is to generate insights, which would help in architecting future computers that are 
more energy-efficient, capable, reliable, and secure. \n

*\<span style=\"color: red\"\> I am always looking for self-motivated and 
talented students to join my lab. We have several funded RA positions. \<\/span\>* 
Send me a /brief email/ to start the conversation. All graduate admissions are 
formally managed by [http://www.wm.edu/as/computerscience/graduate/ W&M CS department].

== Recent News
- I will be co-chairing (with Onur Kayiran) the 12th Workshop on General Purpose Processing Using GPU (GPGPU 2019) to be held with ASPLOS 2019.
Preliminary [https://insight-archlab.github.io/gpgpu.html website] is up.

- I am invited to serve on the [https://www.sigmetrics.org/sigmetrics2019/ Sigmetrics 2019], [https://www.iccd-conf.com/Home.html ICCD 2019], 
and [http://www.hpdc.org/ HPDC 2019] program committees, and [http://hpca2019.seas.gwu.edu/ HPCA 2019] 
external program committee. Submit your best work!

be held at [https://www.microarch.org/micro51/ MICRO'18]. [http://www.cs.wm.edu/~hyliu/ Hongyuan Liu]
will be presenting [https://adwaitjog.github.io/docs/pdf/hotcoldap-micro18.pdf our recent MICRO'18 
paper] on efficiently executing large-scale automata.

- [https://massemibrahim.github.io/ Mohamed Ibrahim] and 
[https://woodun.github.io/ Haonan Wang] are back in the lab from summer internships 
at AMD Research and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), 
respectively. [http://www.cs.wm.edu/~gakadam/ 
Gurunath Kadam] will be completing a co-op at Intel Labs this Fall. 

- Two papers accepted at [https://www.microarch.org/micro51/ MICRO'18]. These 
two papers cover two different topics: a) architectural support for efficient 
large-scale automata processing, and b) practical GPU reliability analysis. 
Congratulations to my students and collaborators.

[http://cgo.org/cgo2019/ CGO'19]. The conference [http://cgo.org/cgo2019/ website] 
and [http://cgo.org/cgo2019/cfp/ call for papers] is up! 

- [https://adwaitjog.github.io/teach/acaces2018.html ACACES 2018 course website] is 
up with the lecture material. This [http://acaces.hipeac.net/2018/index.php?page=courseinfo&lecturer=jog 
short GPU course] is a part of the computer architecture summer school organized annually by HiPEAC.
