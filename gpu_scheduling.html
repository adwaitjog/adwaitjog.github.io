<h2>1st GPU Work Scheduling Championship (GPU-WSC), to be held in conjunction with <a href="http://www.microarch.org/micro48/">MICRO 2015, Waikiki, Hawaii</a></h2>
<p>The workshop on computer architecture competitions is a forum for holding contests to evaluate computer architecture 
research topics. This workshop is organized around a competition for work scheduling algorithms for Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). 
This 1st GPU Work Scheduling Championship (GPU-WSC) invites contestants to submit their GPU scheduler design to participate 
in this competition. The contestants must develop algorithms to optimize multiple metrics (e.g., IPC, cache miss-rates, 
memory bandwidth utilization, hardware overheads etc.) on a common evaluation framework provided by the organizing committee. </p>
<p>This championship covers the following <b><i>GPU-core-centric</i></b> work scheduling topics:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Warp or Wavefront Scheduling</p>
</li>
<li><p>Thread-block or CTA Scheduling</p>
</li>
<li><p>Any combination of the above</p>
</li>
<li><p>Please email the organizers if your scheduler may fit into <b><i>GPU-core-centric</i></b> work scheduler category, but not listed above.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Championship Process</h2>
<p>There are two following phases in the entire championship process:</p>
<p><b><span style="color: forestgreen">Phase 1: Write-up Submission</span></b> <br />
Interested participants are invited to submit a write-up describing their GPU work scheduler design. This write-up must 
clearly demonstrate the idea, motivation, design trade-offs, and estimate the hardware overheads of their proposed 
scheduler. In addition, write-up should provide details on the evaluation methodology and impact of their proposed scheduler 
on four metrics: 1) IPC, 2) L1 miss-rates (all three caches: data, texture, constant), 3) L2 miss-rates, and 4) DRAM bandwidth 
utilization, in comparison to the standard GTX480 GPU configuration. The comparison results 
should be described in the paper with the help of clearly visible graphs. Please refer to the 
Simulation Infrastructure section for details regarding the simulation platform and applications. </p>
<p>The Program Committee chaired by the organizers will review the submitted write-ups. The submission will 
be evaluated based on the novelty, presentation of the results, and effectiveness of the proposed scheduler 
on different metrics. Novelty is not a strict requirement, for example, a contestant may submit his/her 
previously published design or make incremental enhancements to a previously proposed design. </p>
<p>For the phase 1, code submission is <b>not</b> required. </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><b><span style="color: forestgreen">Phase 2: Final Write-up and Code Submission</span></b> <br />
The authors of the accepted write-ups will be required to submit their final write-ups along with the 
source code, output result files (dump the simulator output to a file), and a <i>diff</i> of your code with 
the unmodified GPGPU-Sim version 3.2.2. In this phase, authors have an option to <b>incrementally</b>
revise their scheduler design code to become more competitive. We expect these changes to be only
related to some optimizations with regard to their scheduler design. A complete change in the scheduler
design is not acceptable.</p>
<p>Please note that you are required to 
use GPGPU-Sim version 3.2.2. If we cannot compile you code as is, we cannot evaluate your scheduler. 
If you use a different version of GPGPU-Sim, we cannot fairly compare your scheduler with the schedulers
developed by other contestants. So, it is <b>important</b> to use the same exact version (i.e., 3.2.2).</p>
<p><b>Evaluation of Schedulers:</b>
The submitted source codes will be tested by the organizers on the applications recommended by us (see
Simulation Infrastructure section below).
The organizers may include some applications in the testing set that may not be known apriori to the 
contestants. The final ranking of the schedulers will be based on performance (IPC). We will also 
separately rank the schedulers considering other metrics such as hardware overheads, miss-rates, 
bandwidth utilization, and quality of the final write-up.  </p>
<p><b>Incentives:</b>
The winner(s) will receive a trophy commemorating his/her triumph (OR some other prize to be determined later). 
Authors of all the accepted write-ups will also be invited to present their papers at the workshop. 
All source code, final write-ups, and ranking results will be made publicly available through this website. </p>
