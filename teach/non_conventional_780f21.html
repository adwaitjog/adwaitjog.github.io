</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Course Description</h2>
<p>It is a reading course where we will cover several non-conventional computing paradigms and architectures such as quantum computers, graphics architectures, cryogenic designs, and machine learning accelerators. The evaluation will be based on paper presentations, semester-long project, class participation etc. No prior background in computer architecture 
or any of the aforementioned topics is required.
</p>
<h2>Grade Distribution</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Class Participation: 20%
</p>
</li>
<li><p>Paper critiques: 25%
</p>
</li>
<li><p>In-Class Presentations: 30%
</p>
</li>
<li><p>Semester-long Research Project: 25%
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Class Participation</h2>
<p>(20 percent) You are expected to participate in the discussions. Your participation will be evaluated by the instructor. Regular meetings with the instructor on the projects also count. 
</p>
<h2>Paper Critiques</h2>
<p>(25 percent) Quantum Team will write critiques for the Graphics papers and vice-versa. Around 5-8 papers in total.
</p>
<p><b>Deadline</b> for the critique submission is just before the class when the paper is scheduled
to be discussed. 
</p>
<p><b>Submission Format:</b> Each critique should not exceed one-page (in the PDF format) 
and must consists of four sections: 1) paper summary (2-3 lines), 2) strengths 
(2-3 lines), 3) weaknesses (2-3 lines), and 4) comments (4-5 lines). 
</p>
<h2>In-Class Presentations </h2>
<p>(20 percent) Each student will present 1-2 papers throughout the semester. 
When you present a paper, be prepared to answer a variety of questions asked 
by the instructor or other fellow students. A list of papers will be provided
to students. 
</p>
<p>(10 percent) We will have two project presentations
during the entire semester: mid-term presentation and 
final presentation.
</p>
<h2>Semester-long Research Project</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>It will give you a taste of computer architecture research. Please 
discuss with the instructor to decide on the project. Regular meetings 
are expected with the instructor so that progress can be made. 
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>Can be performed in groups of 2. If you perform the project in a 
group, briefly describe your individual contributions to the project 
in the presentations and final report. 
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>(25 percent) The final project report due in the finals week. Please
use IEEE or ACM conference formats. The report length should be around 
6 pages (including references).
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Piazza (Discussion Forum) and Blackboard</h2>
<p>We will be using Piazza as an on-line forum for discussions. You will 
also receive notifications from the instructor via Piazza. 
Blackboard will contain course materials. All the submissions will 
be via Blackboard.
