== Class Attendance (In-person)
- The modality of this class is in-person. There is no plan to record lectures. There is also no plan to allow students to join the class virtually. 
- You are expected to attend *all* lectures *in-person*. If you cannot attend in person, please e-mail the course staff (ahead of time, if possible) with a reason (e.g., university-related travel, sick -- please don't provide any specifics). 
- Course staff will be taking attendance to have a record of your in-person attendance. As long as you attend at least 80% of classes in-person (exceptions listed below), no points will be deducted related to class attendance. 
- If you miss the class on the day of your presentation without sufficient notice, zero points will be awarded. 

== Scribe
During the papers presentations, instructor will assign scribing duties to 1-2 students. Their job would be to summarize the class discussions and come up with a document that can be shared with the entire class. 

== Paper Critiques
*Deadline* for the review submission is just before the class when the paper is scheduled to be discussed. 

*Submission Format:* Each critique should not exceed one-page (in the PDF format) 
and must consists of four sections: 1) paper summary (2-3 lines), 2) strengths 
(2-3 lines), 3) weaknesses (2-3 lines), and 4) comments (2-3 paras). 

== In-Class Presentations 
Each student will present a few papers throughout the semester (actual number will depend on the number of 
students enrolled in the class). When you present a paper, be prepared to answer a variety of questions asked 
by the instructor or other fellow students. Paper assignment will be done by the instructor. 

== Semester-long Research Project 
- It will give you a taste of computer architecture research. Please 
discuss with the instructor to decide on the project. Regular meetings 
are expected with the instructor so that progress can be made. 

- You can do the semester-long course project in a group of two or individually. Always describe your individual contributions to the project in the presentations and final report. 

- The final project report will be due in the finals week. Please
use IEEE or ACM conference formats. The report length should not be more than
10 pages (excluding references).

- Students will be also asked to do two project presentations during the entire semester: 
mid-term presentation and final presentation.

== Resources 
- *Materials:* We will primarily use UVA Canvas for delivering and submitting materials. Piazza (link available on Canvas) will be used for course announcements and discussions. Gradescope (link available on Canvas) will be used for submissions. 
- *Help:* It is important to start working early on project and other deliverables. If you need help, show up during office hours or ask questions in or after the class. You are also highly encouraged to use Piazza to ask questions. 

== Optional Textbooks and Resources

== Academic Integrity
- The university, school, and department policies against academic dishonesty will be strictly enforced.
- Students are required to follow the UVA Honor Code. More details can be found [https://honor.virginia.edu/ here].
- The ethical use of artificial intelligence technologies is strictly at the discretion of the instructor and is otherwise prohibited without the instructor's explicit written or verbal permission. Artificial Intelligence tools may not be cited as authors, though the tools used must be fully disclosed as a source along with the capacity in which they were used. All outputs of artificial intelligence, both explicitly used and as inspiration in one’s submission, must be properly cited to its appropriate source.  

== Students with disabilities or learning needs 
It is my goal to create a learning experience that is as accessible as possible. If you anticipate any issues related to the format, materials, or requirements of this course, please meet with me outside of class so we can explore potential options. Students with disabilities may also wish to work with the Student Disability Access Center (SDAC) to discuss a range of options to removing barriers in this course, including official accommodations. We are fortunate to have an SDAC advisor, Courtney MacMasters, physically located in Engineering. You may [cmacmasters@virginia.edu email] her at to schedule an appointment. For general questions please visit the [https://www.studenthealth.virginia.edu/SDAC SDAC website]. If you have already been approved for accommodations through SDAC, please send me your accommodation letter and meet with me so we can develop an implementation plan together.

== Religious accommodations 
It is the University's long-standing policy and practice to reasonably accommodate students so that they do not experience an adverse academic consequence when sincerely held religious beliefs or observances conflict with academic requirements.

Students who wish to request academic accommodation for a religious observance should submit their request to me by email as far in advance as possible. Students who have questions or concerns about academic accommodations for religious observance or religious beliefs may contact the [https://eocr.virginia.edu/religious-accommodations University’s Office for Equal Opportunity and Civil Rights (EOCR)] at UVAEOCR@virginia.edu or 434-924-3200.

== Harassment, Discrimination, and Interpersonal Violence
The University of Virginia is dedicated to providing a safe and equitable learning environment for all students. 
If you or someone you know has been affected by power-based personal violence, more information can be found on the [http://www.virginia.edu/sexualviolence UVA Sexual Violence website] that describes reporting options and resources available. 

The same resources and options for individuals who experience sexual misconduct are available for discrimination, harassment, and retaliation.  [https://uvapolicy.virginia.edu/policy/HRM-009 UVA prohibits discrimination and harassment] based on age, color, disability, family medical or genetic information, gender identity or expression, marital status, military status, national or ethnic origin, political affiliation, pregnancy (including childbirth and related conditions), race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, or veteran status. [https://uvapolicy.virginia.edu/policy/HRM-010 UVA policy] also prohibits retaliation for reporting such behavior. 

If you witness or are aware of someone who has experienced prohibited conduct, you are encouraged to submit a report to [https://justreportit.virginia.edu/ Just Report It] or contact EOCR, the office of Equal Opportunity and Civil Rights.

If you would prefer to disclose such conduct to a confidential resource where what you share is not reported to the University, you can turn to [https://www.studenthealth.virginia.edu/caps Counseling & Psychological Services (“CAPS”)] and [https://womenscenter.virginia.edu/counseling/our-counseling-services Women’s Center Counseling Staff and Confidential Advocates] (for students of all genders).  

As your professor and as a person, know that I care about you and your well-being and stand ready to provide support and resources as I can. As a faculty member, I am a responsible employee, which means that I am required by University policy and by federal law to report certain kinds of conduct that you report to me to the University's Title IX Coordinator. The Title IX Coordinator's job is to ensure that the reporting student receives the resources and support that they need, while also determining whether further action is necessary to ensure survivor safety and the safety of the University community. 

== Support for your career development
Engaging in your career development is an important part of your student experience. For example, presenting at a research conference, attending an interview for a job or internship, or participating in an extern/shadowing experience are not only necessary steps on your path but are also invaluable lessons in and of themselves. I wish to encourage and support you in activities related to your career development. To that end, please notify me by email as far in advance as possible to arrange for appropriate accommodations.

== Student support team
You have many resources available to you when you experience academic or personal stresses. In addition to your professor, the School of Engineering and Applied Science has staff members located in Thornton Hall who you can contact to help manage academic or personal challenges. Please do not wait until the end of the semester to ask for help! 

== Community and Identity
The [https://engineering.virginia.edu/about/diversity-and-engagement/center-diversity-engineering Center for Diversity in Engineering (CDE)] is a student space dedicated to advocating for underrepresented groups in STEM. It exists to connect students with the academic, financial, health, and community resources they need to thrive both at UVA and in the world.  The CDE includes an open study area, event space, and staff members on site. Through this space, we affirm and empower equitable participation toward intercultural fluency and provide the resources necessary for students to be successful during their academic journey and future careers.
