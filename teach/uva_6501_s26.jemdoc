== Programming Assignments and Paper reviews
- There will be some CUDA programming assignments assigned. 
- *Deadline* for the review submission is just before the class when the paper is scheduled to be discussed. 

*Submission Format:* Each review should not exceed one-page (in the PDF format) and must consists of four sections: 1) paper summary (2-3 lines), 2) strengths 
(2-3 lines), 3) weaknesses (2-3 lines), and 4) comments (2-3 paras). 

== In-Class Presentations (In-person)
Each student will present 1-2 papers throughout the semester. When you present a paper, be prepared to answer a variety of questions asked by the instructor or other fellow students. Paper assignment will be done by the instructor.  

== Semester-long Research Project 
- Please discuss with the instructor to decide on the project and come up with a proposal. Regular meetings are expected with the course staff so that progress can be made. Please consider basing your project on an established open-source project (e.g., TensorRT, TensorRT-LLM, nccl, nvshmem, NVFlare, cutlass, SPARK, ROCm, OpenCompute, vLLM, gsplat, GPGPU-Sim, MGPUSim, and several other open-source projects from NVIDIA, AMD, and others). You may also consider an artifact released as a part of the conference paper. A more detailed document with guidelines can be found on Canvas. 

- You can do the semester-long course project in a group (max 2 students in a group). Always describe your individual contributions to the project in the presentations and final report. Discuss with the instructor to select the project and finalize a feasible direction. Instructor approval of the proposal is required before proceeding. 

- The final project report will be due in the finals week. Please use IEEE or ACM conference formats. The report length should not be more than 10 pages (excluding references).

- Students will be also asked to do multiple project-related presentations during the entire semester: 
proposal, mid-term presentation, and final presentation.

As your professor and as a person, know that I care about you and your well-being and stand ready to provide support and resources as I can. As a faculty member, I am a responsible employee, which means that I am required by University policy and by federal law to report certain kinds of conduct that you report to me to the University's Title IX Coordinator. The Title IX Coordinator's job is to ensure that the reporting student receives the resources and support that they need, while also determining whether further action is necessary to ensure survivor safety and the safety of the University community. 

== Support for your career development
Engaging in your career development is an important part of your student experience. For example, presenting at a research conference, attending an interview for a job or internship, or participating in an extern/shadowing experience are not only necessary steps on your path but are also invaluable lessons in and of themselves. I wish to encourage and support you in activities related to your career development. To that end, please notify me by email as far in advance as possible to arrange for appropriate accommodations.
