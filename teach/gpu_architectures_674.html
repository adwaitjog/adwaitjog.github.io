<h2>GPU Architectures, Spring 2019, CSCI 674 </h2>
<h2>General Information</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Time and Location: Tuesday/Thursday 9:30 am - 10:50am, Tucker Hall 222</p>
</li>
<li><p>Instructor: Adwait Jog <a href="http://adwaitjog.github.io/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>(Personal Website)</a></p>
</li>
<li><p>Office hours: By appointment, McGl 111</p>
</li>
<li><p>Email: ajog@wm.edu </p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>Students are expected to have a good understanding of the basic
computer organization and design (i.e., comparable to the material 
covered by CSCI 424/524). Please talk to the instructor if you do 
not satisfy this requirement. </p>
<h2>Course Description</h2>
<p>This course provides an in-depth understanding of the micro-architectural and 
architectural details of a general-purpose graphics processing unit (GPU). A range of 
top-tier architecture conference and journal papers are also discussed to understand the 
important research issues associated with the GPU architectures. Students will be tested 
via various assignments and a written examination. In addition, students will also be 
required to complete a semester-long research project.</p>
<h2>Grade Distribution</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Homeworks: 40%</p>
</li>
<li><p>Semester-long Research Project: 40%</p>
</li>
<li><p>Final Exam: 20%</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Homeworks</h2>
<p>Homeworks are due in hard copy before the deadline. Submit it to the instructor at the beginning
of the class. Homeworks will test analytical, coding, and simulation skills. Homeworks need 
to be done individually but one can collaborate with one more student enrolled in this 
class. If you do so, please mention the name of the collaborator in the submission document. </p>
<h2>Semester-long Research Project</h2>
<p>It will give you a taste of computer architecture research. 
Ideally performed in groups of 2. Regular meetings are expected with the instructor so that 
progress can be made. We will have three project presentations during the entire semester: 
proposal, mid-term report, and final presentation. Also, a final project report will be 
due in the finals week. If you perform the project in a group, briefly describe your 
individual contributions to the project in the submission document.</p>
<h2>Final Exam</h2>
<p>It will be comprehensive and will cover all the material covered until the end 
of the semester. The final exam is scheduled by W&amp;M and the date will be announced soon.</p>
