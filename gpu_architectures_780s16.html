</ul>
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>Students are expected to have a good understanding of the basic
computer organization and design. Please talk to the instructor 
if you do not satisfy this requirement. </p>
<h2>Course Description</h2>
<p>This course provides an in-depth understanding of the architectural and micro-architectural details 
of a general purpose graphics processing unit (GPU). It also provides an in-depth coverage of 
important research issues associated with GPU computing by covering a range of latest papers 
that have appeared in leading international journals and conferences. Students are expected 
to read a variety of papers, critique them, and present them in the front of the class. 
In addition, students are expected to complete a semester-long research project. </p>
<h2>Grade Distribution</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Simulation-based Assignments: 20%</p>
</li>
<li><p>Paper critiques: 15%</p>
</li>
<li><p>In-Class Presentations: 15%</p>
</li>
<li><p>Semester-long Research Project: 50%</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Submissions</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Critique and Report Submissions via Box.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In-Class Presentations will be uploaded in the Box folder (shared with students).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Semester-long research project report submissions need to be emailed to the instructor. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Final grade submission via Banner.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Simulation-based Assignments</h2>
<p>Assignments will be given based on the <a href="http://www.gpgpu-sim.org/">GPGPU-Sim</a> simulator. More details to follow soon.</p>
<h2>Paper Critiques </h2>
<p>All students are required to submit a detailed critique for each paper we discuss 
in the class. However, the student who presents the paper in-class is not required
to submit the critique for that particular paper. <b>Deadline for critique submission
is one week from when the paper is discussed completely in the class. Please submit
them in the PDF format.</b> </p>
<p><b>Submission Format:</b> Each critique should not exceed one-page and must consists of four 
sections: 1) paper summary (2-3 lines), 2) strengths (2-3 lines), 3) weaknesses (2-3 lines), 
and 4) detailed comments (rest of the page). More details are already discussed in class 
and associated slides are submitted to the box folder (shared with students).</p>
<p><i>No collaboration is allowed on critiques.</i></p>
<h2>In-Class Presentations </h2>
<p>Each student will present a maximum of two papers throughout the semester. 
If you plan to audit the course, you are required to present at least two papers. When you 
present a paper, be prepared to answer a variety of questions asked by the instructor 
or other fellow students. The goal is to make class lively. A list of papers will be provided
to students. They can choose from that list or come up with their own suggestions. Suggestions
would need approval from the instructor. </p>
<p><b>In-Class Paper Presentations:</b> I expect students to first present necessary 
background (~15 minutes) and then paper details (~25 minutes). The remaining
time will be for discussion driven by the fellow students and the instructor.<br /></p>
<h2>Semester-Long Research Project</h2>
<p>Students are expected to perform a semester-long research
project. All projects need to be approved by the instructor. Students can 
work in groups if they wish, but not more than <b>2</b> students are allowed to be 
in a single group.  If two people choose to work on the same project, 
the instructor will need a list of individual contributions made by each of you two, 
when you submit your final report. Please contact the instructor early 
to brainstorm potential project ideas. <br />
<br />
<b>Project Timeline</b> <br /></p>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Phase 1 &ndash; Project Determination: <i>(Deadline:)</i></b>; Please send an email to the instructor by 
the deadline containing: 1) Project Name (think of this as your paper/report title), 2) Problem Statement, 
3) Expected Infrastructure Platform Required, 4) Possible Outcomes and Deliverables. <br /></p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Phase 2 &ndash; Determination of (more) concrete project goals and Infrastructure Setup <i>(Deadline: )</i></b>;
Please meet the instructor during office hours to discuss the status of your project.</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Phase 3 &ndash; Motivation Results  <i>(Deadline: )</i></b>; Please meet the instructor during office hours 
to discuss the status of your project.</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Phase 4 &ndash; Final Project Report <i>(Deadline: Finals Week)</i></b>; Please email your final project report 
in PDF format. Please use the <a href="http://www.acm.org/publications/article-templates/proceedings-template.html/">standard LaTeX or Word ACM templates</a>. The PDF should have these sections: 1) Problem Statement, 2)
Introduction, 3) Background and Related Work, 4) Motivation Results, 5) Implementation Details, 6) 
Infrastructure Details, 7) Final Results, and 8) Conclusions.</p>
